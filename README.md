# Inspiration 📝
When studying for your upcoming math test, working on your next biology project or even a personal project you find yourself with a problem that you have too many tabs open. The idea of Study Panel is to condense the more unnecessary tabs in your window into one page such as calculator, music, personal jot notes, calendar etc. so that your window is less congested and more organized while your studying, working or even leisurely roaming the internet.

# What it does 🖋️
Study Panel is a small platform that allows you to access your studying necessities all in one place so you do not have to have a bunch of tabs open on your window while working. The website page is simple and easy to navigate with a variety of sections to aid your studying such as music, a calendar, a calculator, space to jot down notes and a to-do list. The website also allows you to personally customize the background to your liking so you can navigate through the page with aesthetic pleasure.

# How we built it 🖱️
We built this website using an online IDE called replit with the languages HTML, CSS and JavaScript. To make the project's logo we used Canva.

# Challenges we ran into 🏹
We ran into challenges regarding the format of the website. When we were creating the website the sections of the page were scrollable horizontally instead of appearing on the full screen. We later fixed this by changing the website dimensions to percentages rather than fixed values.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of 🎯
We are proud that we learned how to code a website in a short amount of time using programming languages that we are not too familiar with.

# What we learned 🍎
We learned how to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to embed external sources and links in a website as well as format a website's headers, background etc.
